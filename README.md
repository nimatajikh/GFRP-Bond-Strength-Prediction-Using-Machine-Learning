This repository contains the source code, dataset, and simulation results used in the study: “Ensemble machine learning-based approach with genetic algorithm optimization for predicting bond strength and failure mode in concrete-GFRP mat anchorage interface.”

# **Overview**

Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are increasingly used in reinforced concrete due to their corrosion resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio. However, their bond performance with concrete—especially at the anchorage interface—remains a concern. This study applies advanced ensemble machine learning algorithms, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, to predict:

Flexural bond strength

Failure mode (bar rupture vs. bond failure)
of handmade mat-anchored sand-coated GFRP bars embedded in concrete.
